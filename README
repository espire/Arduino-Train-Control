Arduino Train Control's goal is to become an ideal alternative to DCC train control for those who desire cost savings or finer control over their electric trains.

ATC uses the Adafruit Motor Shield, which feeds external power through H-bridges. That library is available at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library.git The H-bridges are given a high-frequency pulse width-modulated signal, allowing virtual voltage for train speed control. The motor shield can power standard electric turnouts as well as electric trains.

Unlike many Arduino projects, ATC will be built with object-oriented programming, ensuring that the code can be reused easily.

There isn't any real documentation yet, and there probably won't be any for a while. Requires Arduino 1.0 or higher.
